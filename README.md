Piebald-Android
=====================

Piebald is an application for appreciation and downloading of stunning photograph. [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) is the image source.
This is my first project for development practice. I'm sure that there are many defects in this project. I will apreciate your advices or criticisms. And I 'm glad if somebody help me to perfect Piebald.
